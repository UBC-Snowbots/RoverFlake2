# Cameras
This package is newly implemented in 2024 from https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/Snowflake/tree/master/src/cameras originally to view both Intel cameras that UBC Rover owns: the Intel Realsense D415 and D435i

I've added a few other features from the original, and made some changes for ROS2.

The serial number of the D415 is 739112061033

The serial number of the D435i is 116622072291

These serial numbers are reflected in the launch files in this directory.
